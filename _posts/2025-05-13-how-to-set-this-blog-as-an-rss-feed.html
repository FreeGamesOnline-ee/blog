This might sound complicated at first, but once you get the hang of it, it will be so easy!

<h2>Get the RSS Link</h2>
At the bottom at the page, you should find something like this: <br />
<img src="/blog/assets/posts/images/sub-via-rss.jpg" /><br />
You will need to click the <strong>Subscribe via RSS</strong> link, this should show you a page like this:<br/>
<img src="/blog/assets/posts/images/blog-rss.jpg"/><br />
From there we can get the feed link, there's two ways:
<ul>
  <li>Searching for the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element</li>
  <li>Getting the page URL</li>
</ul>

To get the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element, you need to look at around the third line.<br/>
Now, for the other method, you need to get the page's URL, now this is pretty easy, so we aren't gonna explain it here.

<h2>End</h2>

Here you go! You finished the tutorial, you finally got the RSS feed, the last step is to put it in your favourite RSS reader!

<strong>Note:</strong> This can work for most blogs, if the blog doesn't have a Subscribe via RSS button, try just going to for example: <code>https://blog.com/feed.xml</code>.
